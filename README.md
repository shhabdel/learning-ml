# My journey to learning data science and machine learning 
This repository will include all the small projects that I work on through my learning journey.     
Each project will containt a small video demonstration as well as the link to the original source if it's not my own idea.
My goal is to continue to add on to this repo as the semester goes by.     

## Projects 
### Cartoonify 
Turn any picture into a cartoon! 
- Used OpenCV with Python to edit an image and give it a "cartoon effect"
