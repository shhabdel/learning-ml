## Cartoonify 

This project is used to turn any image into a cartoon!   

To give the effect of a cartoon, the program inhances the edges and smoothes the colors of the image.    
- To inhance and detect the edges, it uses the adaptive thresholding technique.     
- To smooth the colors of the image, it uses a bilateral filter.    

When the program runs, a small window pops up asking the user to select an image from their files.    
Then, the program runs, it displays several plots of the images at different points of transformation.    
Afterwards, a button appears on the window for the option to save the cartoonfied image.    
When pressed, the button saves the image to the same path as the original image with the same name plus "_cartoonified".    

Here's a quick demo!
